                    <p class="text-muted text-left">Perhaps the work of the Society of Jesus begun by Ignatius that is best known is that of education. It is interesting that he had no intention of including teaching among the Jesuits' works at the beginning. As already mentioned, the purpose of the first members was to be at the disposal of the Pope to go where they would be most needed. Before 1548 Ignatius had opened schools in Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, and India. These schools, however, were intended primarily for the education of the new young Jesuit recruits. Ten such colleges built within six years indicated the rapid growth of the Jesuits. But in 1548 at the request of the magistrates of Messina in Sicily, Ignatius sent five men to open a school for lay as well as Jesuit students. It soon became clear by requests from rulers, bishops and cities for schools that this work was truly one of the most effective ways to correct ignorance and corruption among the clergy and the faithful, to stem the decline of the Church in the face of the Reformation, and to fulfill the motto of the Society of Jesus, "Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam," - to the greater glory of God.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">The stage has always been held in great honour at St. Xavier’s. For an educational institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate – to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn collectively. As we stand at the threshold of another century in the history of St. Xavier’s College, it is meet that we go down memory lane and find out how students gathered here when it all began 130 odd years ago, how this place changed over the century, and how it is now poised to provide a space for even greater creative, cultural and social events, something that St. Xavier’s College has always been noted for.</p>

                <p>he Counselling Cell of St. Xavier’s College provides personal and vocational guidance to students of all the departments of the College. Personal Counselling Sessions are conducted at the Centre by qualified and experienced Counsellors to help students resolve any kind of problems that they might face. These are client-oriented and are conducted on a one-to-one basis with each student where the Counsellor brings an utterly non-judgemental attitude to the table. Besides career-related problems, personal issues are also dealt with. Confidentiality is a legal requirement of counselling, and is strictly maintained. Thus the Counselling Cell provides a platform for students to pursue both their professional and personal goals with greater self-awareness, self-esteem, understanding and a focus. The Cell is located in Room 104 (Jubilee Building) of the College.



                    Confidence issues, choosing the right career path, making choices in the various parts of life, self-doubt, peer pressure, relationship issues are only some of the problems that young people often face.



                    Choosing the right career path is also, often, a dilemma that the students face. The Cell provides vocational guidance to students based on an analysis of their personality, talents and interest. Insights into suitable work environments are also provided in vocational guidance. For example, a person with creative personality will succeed as a writer and a person who is an introvert is less likely to succeed in face to face sales promotion. If you choose a field that excites you, you will not only enjoy your work but will also excel in your chosen field. Understanding your personality is key in choosing the right career path.

                <p>Science is not only about mere logical facts and technical figures. Science is about innovation, it provides the power to imagine and hence, create. Science is the poetry of reality. With this spirit, the Science Association of St. Xavier’s College (Autonomous), Kolkata takes pride in bringing science to life by accommodating students with a keen interest in science, and providing them with the platform to showcase and even sharpen their skills. Established with an aim to foster interest for science, it sparks out fuel in the mind of science students, who seek to recognize an interest in scientific activities, and it further nurtures this interest with the help of inter and intra college extra-curricular activities. This session is not an exception. The association has conducted a wide range of activities throughout the academic session, 2019-20.

                    It has organised Machine Learning Study Jams for its members, which was a great experience for the students to gain practical experience in Machine Learning and work with like minded people. The association has also actively encouraged research activities and blogging, and has commemorated scientific discoveries and scientists by way of the same. Finally, it has witnessed the thirteenth annual event of Science Association ‘SIGMA’, with the focal theme being “A Transit Through Time” on 11th and 12 of February, 2020. As all the departments of science converged in this fest, the theme, indeed, seemed befitting with a view of collaborating and conducting a variety of events ranging across all disciplines, be it, technology, biological sciences or the pure sciences. While general events included Treasure hunt, Debate and Quiz; events requiring specialisation in a particular field included an intriguing Integration Battle and Coding and Encryption. The Science Exhibition of Sigma, EUREKA was a grand success, where students were invited to present working models from various disciplines of science to share their innovative ideas and inspire other young aspirants as well. Apart from this, the event culminated with the launch of ‘Pebbles’, the Annual Magazine of Science Association. This year we have launched the magazine in soft copy version as we believe that it will have a better reach.

                    The basic requirement for any country or society to set up model for development is new technology and that will be impossible without investment in science. So, this association serve as a platform for manifestation of the scientific aptitude of the students while indulging in healthy competition and other festivities throughout the year. We try to encourage each and every student from the disciplines of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Microbiology, Biotechnology, Computer Science, Economics, Statistics, Multimedia and Mass Communication departments to be a part of the association. Lastly we would like mention that we will be more than happy to have you by our side in our future journey.
